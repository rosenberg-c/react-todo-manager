# Go Repository & Storage Rules

## 1. Never take addresses of range loop variables

- Bad: for _, v := range slice { return &v }
- Good: Use index-based access: for i := range slice { return &slice[i] }

## 2. Build file paths with filepath.Join

- Bad: String concatenation for paths
- Good: filepath.Join(basePath, "file.json")

## 3. Prefer values over pointers for loaded data

- Return structs unless you truly need shared mutable state.
- If returning pointers, ensure they point to stable memory (slice element, not loop variable).

## 4. Guard against duplicate data on create

- Validate uniqueness (IDs, usernames) before appending.
- Return explicit domain errors (ErrAlreadyExists).

## 5. Assume persistence is slow and fragile

- Minimize full read–modify–write cycles.
- Expect failures on load and save; wrap errors with context.

## 6. Protect read–modify–write with locking

- If concurrent access is possible, use sync.Mutex (repo or store level).
- JSON-file storage is not concurrency-safe by default.

## 7. Keep repositories testable

Prefer dependency injection:

- Bad: NewRepo(path string)
- Good: NewRepo(store Store)
- Avoid hardcoding file paths inside logic.

## 8. Document exported symbols

- Every exported type or function should have a GoDoc comment only when it adds information not obvious from the name or signature.

- Comments must explain non-obvious behavior, edge cases, guarantees, or reasons (“why”), not restate the function name (“what”).

Guidelines:

- Avoid comments that merely paraphrase the identifier.
- Prefer documenting:
  - error conditions and guarantees
  - side effects
  - performance or concurrency implications
  - invariants and assumptions

Examples:

- Bad: // GetByID gets by ID
- Good: // GetByID returns ErrNotFound if no user with the given ID exists.

## 9. Nil slices are valid

- Returning nil slices is idiomatic.
- Only normalize to empty slices if required for JSON output or API contracts.

## 10. Design for future growth

- Consider context.Context in method signatures.
- Treat file-backed repos as prototypes, not scalable storage.
